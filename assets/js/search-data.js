        description: "The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has largely been defined by a dichotomy: the flexible, probabilistic learning of Connectionism versus the rigorous, compositional logic of Symbolism. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fostering a synthesis of these paradigms through a fundamental architectural shift: the move from Dense Monoliths to Modular, Routed Systems. This shift is fractal. At the Macro level, LLMs function as central planners, using symbolic protocols to orchestrate external tools and specialized neural agents. Simultaneously, at the Micro level, the models themselves are evolving into sparse, modular structures (such as Mixture-of-Experts) governed by internal routing mechanisms. In this post, we explore this transition toward Symbolic Routing. We discuss how this paradigm enables us to build societies of neural agents, discover latent modularity within dense networks, thus enabling composable, verifiable, interpretable and continually learnable AI system. And we also discuss how to leverage these structures to synthesize training data and formally verify AI reasoning.",

A Gridworld example evaluating both training speed and accuracy is utilized to test each of these packages.

These methods typically assume that simulators faithfully represent the true data-generating process, an assumption that is often violated in practice. Resulting discrepancies can make observed data effectively out-of-distribution relative to the simulations, leading to biased posterior distributions and misleading uncertainty quantification. This post reviews recent work on model misspecification in neural SBI, covering formal definitions, methods for detection and mitigation, and their underlying assumptions. It also discusses practical implications for SBI workflows and outlines open challenges for developing robust SBI methods that remain reliable in realistic, imperfectly specified applications.",

Optimizing for these abstract tests can pull evaluation away from real-world usefulness. We argue for a shift from chasing intelligence to measuring generality. This reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks.",

        description: "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more powerful and autonomous, they increasingly face conflicts and dilemmas in many scenarios. We first summarize and taxonomize these diverse conflicts. Then, we model the LLM&#39;s preferences to make different choices as a priority graph, where instructions and values are nodes, and the edges represent context-specific priorities determined by the model&#39;s output distribution. This graph reveals that a unified stable LLM alignment is very challenging, because the graph is not static in different contexts. Besides, it also reveals a potential vulnerability: priority hacking, where adversaries can craft deceptive contexts to manipulate the graph and bypass safety alignments. To counter this, we propose a runtime verification mechanism, enabling LLMs to query external sources to ground their context and resist manipulation. While this approach enhances robustness, we also acknowledge that many ethical and value dilemmas are philosophically irreducible, posing an open challenge for the future of AI alignment.",

The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training remains stable over thousands of steps without intervention.

        description: "In the age of rapidly released LLMs, evaluation reporting is fragmented, inconsistent, and often misleading. We surveyed the landscape and found three critical crises—reproducibility, accessibility, and governance—that Model Cards alone can&#39;t solve. Our solution? EvalCards-- lightweight, standardized evaluation summaries that are easy to write, easy to understand, and impossible to miss. EvalCards are designed to enhance transparency for both researchers and practitioners while providing a practical foundation to meet emerging governance requirements.",

Stakeholders therefore need a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compatible method to price both (i) the agent&#39;s labour-like output and (ii) the data traces that fuel learning. We formalise a single unifying metric - agent Economic Value (AEV)- and demonstrate that these metrics are measurable today. We then extend the template to reinforcement-learning regimes in which grounded rewards equal cash flows. Lastly, we propose a financial settlement layer, which transforms the agent from a passive software user into an active economic participant.",

We show that a wide range of methods mostly instantiate two operator-splitting paradigms, i.e., posterior-guided sampling and clean-space local-MAP optimization. Through manifold diagrams, Tweedie-based animations, and step-by-step derivations, we explain how these paradigms decouple a pretrained diffusion prior from measurement physics, clarify when they approximate full posterior sampling versus MAP estimation, and distill practical design rules for building robust diffusion-based inverse solvers.",
