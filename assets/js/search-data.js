Sampler quality can be evaluated in a data-free manner, using only the model and the target potential, or in a data-driven manner, with additional data about the target distribution such as known modes, summary statistics, and reference MCMC samples. While data-driven eval is valuable, data-free eval has compelling conceptual advantages, raising the question of how well data-free eval could work. Here, we prove an impossibility trilemma for data-free sampler evaluation; we can only have two among i) mode-covering metric, ii) stable with finite variance, iii) universal ranking (dominance transitivity guarantee / model score does not depend on other models). This note surveys underexplored design space of data-free sampler eval metrics, and asks the community which eval properties we are willing to sacrifice in the face of the impossibility of satisfying all of them.",

We take a deeper look into the mechanics and interface of the NLE and show that much of the complexity of NetHack is inaccessible due to constraints on the observation and action spaces.

        description: "Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts. While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies show they often rely on shallow heuristics such as copying or majority voting, rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with reasoning pipeline that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception- and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0 and 2.5. We conduct controlled studies varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, indicating that current VLMs fail to effectively utilize demonstration-level information and thus do not inherit the strong few-shot abilities of large language models (LLMs). We further conduct a mechanistic analysis showing that VLMs exhibit weak prefix matching and lack induction-head-like behavior, which potentially explains the failure of MM-ICL.",

In this blog post, we look at some existing open-endedness definitions and discuss what it would mean to satisfy them and construct attempts at open-endedness that do. By adjusting definitions, we get insights into different forms of partial progress towards constructing open-ended systems.",

        description: "The scalability and robustness of current Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are severely constrained by the heterogeneity of communication interfaces and a reliance on fragile ad-hoc integrations. We introduce FRACTAL-MAS, a recursive architecture that standardizes orchestration through the convergence of MCP and A2A protocols, integrating a unified control loop with procedural memory grounded in Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). This design allows for continuous adaptation without fine-tuning and enables a seamless transition from rigid hierarchical structures to decentralized networks, providing a reference architecture for the robust and scalable construction of MAS.",

        description: "Autoregressive (AR) models are central to modern generative AI systems, yet their sequential inductive bias clashes with modalities that lack an obvious ordering, such as images, graphs, and point clouds. Despite this mismatch, AR models are widely used beyond language, owing to their scalability and controllability. This post highlights the growing set of techniques that make non-sequential data amenable to autoregressive modeling. There are two broad directions: approaches that choose or optimize a generation order for a fixed tokenization, and approaches that redesign the tokenization itself to simplify each next-token prediction step. We emphasize the tradeoffs these methods face, particularly between compression and autoregressive ``modelability”. By drawing these connections, we aim to motivate future work on tokenizations tailored to the needs of autoregressive models for arbitrary datatypes.",
